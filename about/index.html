                <p><br><br><br>András Nagy is digital media artist, living in Hungary. His story is started when he studied sound engineering:<br><br>
                “After many years of understanding the physical movement of sound I become interested in visual art. Digital light is such new technology what we need to discover. And the main power of discovering is light art. I was started to become interesting in this.”
                    <br><br>
                    He contributed on a dozen various musical events, later in 2014 he worked in a cinema dubbing studio. He started to experiment with lights around 2012 after seeing the hungarian scene quality of mappings. He participated in many projection mappings, created installations and LIVE generated visual projects. In these days he is experimenting to combine lights and projection mappings, discovering new technics in digital art.
